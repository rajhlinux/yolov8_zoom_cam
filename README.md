# Supported OS?:

Right now the supported os is Windows 10, however the program can be easily modified or adjusted to work in Linux/Unix systems.

# Why create Yolov8 Zoom Cam?:

I thought it would be an interesting project to perform Yolov8 object detection inference in real time while on a zoom meeting.
Just to be clear, the program performs inference on your camera and not on other's camera and displays the post-processed results to a virtual camera. You use the virtual camera as a legitimate camera device which you would setup on Zoom settings.

The code could be greatly improved in terms of performance. 
I did not spend too much time in optimizing since the project does not have any great value other than for zoom meetings.
Yolov8 inference is performed using ONNX exported model and runs on GPUs using CUDA acceleration using the ONNX runtime engine.

The program also includes a decent practical background subtraction, such that the background can be replaced by a video or picture.
Background subtraction has some variables to be adjusted which might be needed for different cameras. 
Read the code is in `main.cpp` to understand how the background subtraction works.

You will need `akvirtualcamera` to be built and run a virtual camera instance before running this program. 
Read the notes in `main.cpp` how to do this.

You would also need `ONNX Runtime Engine` (GPU version for windows).

# YOLOv8 OnnxRuntime C++

This example demonstrates how to perform inference using YOLOv8 in C++ with ONNX Runtime and OpenCV's API.

## Benefits ✨

- Friendly for deployment in the industrial sector.
- Faster than OpenCV's DNN inference on both CPU and GPU.
- Supports FP32 and FP16 CUDA acceleration.

## Note ☕

1. Benefit for Ultralytics' latest release, a `Transpose` op is added to the YOLOv8 model, while make v8 and v5 has the same output shape. Therefore, you can run inference with YOLOv5/v7/v8 via this project.

## Exporting YOLOv8 Models 📦

To export YOLOv8 models, use the following Python script:

```python
from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a YOLOv8 model
model = YOLO("yolov8n.pt")

# Export the model
model.export(format="onnx", opset=12, simplify=True, dynamic=False, imgsz=640)
```

Alternatively, you can use the following command for exporting the model in the terminal

```bash
yolo export model=yolov8n.pt opset=12 simplify=True dynamic=False format=onnx imgsz=640,640
```

## Exporting YOLOv8 FP16 Models 📦

```python
import onnx
from onnxconverter_common import float16

model = onnx.load(R"YOUR_ONNX_PATH")
model_fp16 = float16.convert_float_to_float16(model)
onnx.save(model_fp16, R"YOUR_FP16_ONNX_PATH")
```

## Download COCO.yaml file 📂

In order to run example, you also need to download coco.yaml. You can download the file manually from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/coco.yaml)

## Dependencies ⚙️

| Dependency                       | Version       |
| -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Onnxruntime(linux,windows,macos) | >=1.14.1      |
| OpenCV                           | >=4.0.0       |
| C++ Standard                     | >=17          |
| Cmake                            | >=3.5         |
| Cuda (Optional)                  | >=11.4 \<12.0 |
| cuDNN (Cuda required)            | =8            |

Note: The dependency on C++17 is due to the usage of the C++17 filesystem feature.

Note (2): Due to ONNX Runtime, we need to use CUDA 11 and cuDNN 8. Keep in mind that this requirement might change in the future.

## Build 🛠️

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository.

3. Create a build directory and navigate to it:

   ```console
   mkdir build && cd build
   ```

4. Run CMake to generate the build files:

   ```console
   cmake ..
   ```

   **Notice**:

   If you encounter an error indicating that the `ONNXRUNTIME_ROOT` variable is not set correctly, you can resolve this by building the project using the appropriate command tailored to your system.

   ```console
   # compiled in a win32 system
   cmake -D WIN32=TRUE ..
   # compiled in a linux system
   cmake -D LINUX=TRUE ..
   # compiled in an apple system
   cmake -D APPLE=TRUE ..
   ```

5. Build the project:

   ```console
   make
   ```

6. The built executable should now be located in the `build` directory.

## Usage 🚀

```c++
//change your param as you like
//Pay attention to your device and the onnx model type(fp32 or fp16)
DL_INIT_PARAM params;
params.rectConfidenceThreshold = 0.1;
params.iouThreshold = 0.5;
params.modelPath = "yolov8n.onnx";
params.imgSize = { 640, 640 };
params.cudaEnable = true;
params.modelType = YOLO_DETECT_V8;
yoloDetector->CreateSession(params);
Detector(yoloDetector);
```
